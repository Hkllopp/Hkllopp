### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, everyone! My name is Augustin BAR, and I'm a passionate data scientist from France!
- ðŸ”­ My path to data science started with a French engineering degree, complemented by online training courses, volunteering, and numerous personal projects
- ðŸŒ± I am driven by curiosity and constantly strive to improve my skills in what I love the most
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my professional endeavors or my personal interests. I am always eager to share my experiences and equally love hearing about other people's passions!
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me through my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/hkllopp). I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals.
- ðŸ˜„ As for my pronouns, you can use either He/Him or They/Them â€“ both work for me.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Apart from my passion for data, I also have a keen interest in parkour! So, if you happen to visit Lyon, don't forget to look up at the roofs and walls â€“ you might catch a glimpse of me jumping around!

See you around !
